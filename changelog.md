= 1.1 = 2024-08-01 =

Introduced a mapping of file names to their paths, allowing only the most recent versions of template files to be retained.
- Optimized Template File Search: Enhanced the `find_template_files` function to utilize `glob` for handling search patterns. This allows for efficient searching of template files matching specific patterns.

- Enhanced Output Security: All outputs generated by `wp_trim_excerpt` and `__` functions have been properly secured using functions like `esc_html` or `wp_kses`, ensuring compliance with WordPress security guidelines and protection against potential XSS attacks.
- Optimized Code Structure: Enhanced code performance and maintainability through structured optimizations.
- Improved Security Measures: Strengthened security protocols and addressed vulnerabilities to bolster code safety.
- Support for new shortcode attributes: `post_type`, `posts_per_page`, `order`, `orderby`, and `post_status`. These attributes can now be set through shortcode parameters.
